# Pong

This is the first project in my 10 projects in JavaScript goal to let me better understand JavaScript and just build new projects since I'm unemployed at the time of this writing.

This is Pong.

Nothing really special. You use your up and down arrow keys to move your paddle against the computer.

There are slight bugs but it's pretty fun to play. Try it out.
